<p>I used my low method blackjack system to predict the winners of each game. The low method is a system where you bet on the team with the lower point spread. If both teams have the same spread, then you bet on the home team.</p>
<p>The results are as follows:<br>Atlanta Falcons (-4) over Philadelphia Eagles<br>Pittsburgh Steelers (-7) over Jacksonville Jaguars<br>New England Patriots (-13.5) over Tennessee Titans<br>Minnesota Vikings (+3) over New Orleans Saints</p>
<p>The Falcons, Steelers, Patriots, and Vikings are all predicted to win their games by more than a touchdown. The Eagles, Jaguars, Titans, and Saints are all predicted to lose by more than a touchdown.</p>
<h1 id="Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-The-best-way-to-win-at-NFL-games"><a href="#Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-The-best-way-to-win-at-NFL-games" class="headerlink" title="Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: The best way to win at NFL games"></a>Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: The best way to win at NFL games</h1><p>First and foremost, the most important number to know is the point spread. The point spread is the margin of victory or defeat that is set by oddsmakers to create an equal amount of betting on both sides. So, if a team is favored by 10 points, that means they need to win by more than 10 points for people who bet on them to collect a payout. Conversely, if they only win by 9 points, then those who bet on the underdog would collect a payout.</p>
<p>The second-most important number for NFL games is the total, which is also known as the over/under. This line reflects how many points oddsmakers believe will be scored in the game combined. So, if you see a total of 47.5, that means both teams combined are expected to score 48 points or more for those betting the over to win; conversely, if you see a total of 44.5, it means under 44.5 points is expected so those betting on the under would win their wager. </p>
<p>Now that you understand how NFL lines work, let’s take a look at some specific strategies when it comes to betting on these games. The first thing you want to do is figure out whether you think the favorite or underdog will cover the point spread. If you think the favorite will blowout their opponent but won’t cover the spread (meaning they’ll still win but not by as many points as the oddsmakers predicted), then you should place a “middle” bet where you wager on both sides: your original bet on the favorite and then also placing a bet on the underdog at halftime once it becomes clear how motivated they are playing against their heavily-favored rival. </p>
<p>If you think an underdog can pull off an upset but won’t cover the point spread, then placing a moneyline bet on them might be your best option - this type of wager simply pays out based on who wins rather than having to worry about covering a point spread. Another strategy to consider when betting on NFL games is taking advantage of sour lines - this occurs when one side has significantly higher odds than the other even though there isn’t much difference between them in terms of talent level or public perception. If you find an unusually high-point spread (for example, Denver as 42-point favorites against Arizona), then taking Arizona +42 would give you very favorable odds and make it likely that you would end up winning your bet</p>
<h1 id="Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-How-to-make-money-off-of-NFL-games"><a href="#Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-How-to-make-money-off-of-NFL-games" class="headerlink" title="Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: How to make money off of NFL games"></a>Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: How to make money off of NFL games</h1><p>The NFL regular season is now in full swing, and for many football fans that means one thing: betting on games. Wagering on the outcomes of NFL matchups can be a lot of fun, but it can also be profitable if you know what you’re doing. In this article, we’re going to teach you how to make money off of NFL games by using a simple method called “low method blackjack.”</p>
<p>Before we get into explaining how low method blackjack works, let’s take a quick look at the different numbers associated with NFL games. The most common number associated with an NFL game is the point spread, which is the margin of victory that the bookmakers think one team will win by. For example, if the New England Patriots are playing the Miami Dolphins and the point spread is -7.5 for New England, that means that the Patriots are expected to win by seven or more points. If you bet on New England -7.5 points, they would have to win by eight or more points for you to win your bet.</p>
<p>There are also over/under bets available for most NFL games. This type of wager allows you to choose whether you think the total number of points scored in the game will be above (over) or below (under) a certain number set by the bookmakers. For example, if the over/under for a game is 44 points, that means that there is a total of 44 points expected to be scored between both teams. If you bet on over 44 points, then any combination of points scored in excess of 44 would result in a winning bet; conversely, if you bet on under 44 points, then any combination of points scored fewer than 44 would result in a winning bet.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered some of basics of NFL wagering, let’s get into how low method blackjack can help you make money off of these bets. Low method blackjack is a simple gambling strategy that can be used when betting on NFL games. It works by splitting your bankroll into two unequal parts; one part is used to bet on the favourite team (the team with the smaller point spread), and the other part is used to bet on the underdog team (the team with the larger point spread).</p>
<p>The idea behind using low method blackjack is that when betting on favourites, you want to make sure that they cover the point spread as quickly as possible so as not to give away any free money; conversely, when betting on underdogs, you want them to keep things close so as not to lose too much money if they lose outright. By using low method blackjack when betting on NFL games, you can increase your chances of winning while minimizing your risk/loss potential.</p>
<p>We hope this article has helped teach you how to make money off of NFL games using low method blackjack. Good luck and have fun!</p>
<h1 id="Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-Football-betting-strategies"><a href="#Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-Football-betting-strategies" class="headerlink" title="Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: Football betting strategies"></a>Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: Football betting strategies</h1><p>There are a variety of football betting strategies that you can employ when looking to make some money from wagers placed on the beautiful game. And, while there is no one strategy that can guarantee success, utilizing a low method blackjack approach can give you a better chance of coming out on top.</p>
<p>But, what does this mean in practice? Essentially, it means that you should place smaller bets when your team is performing well – and increase these when they are struggling. This blackjack strategy will ensure that you don’t lose too much money if your side falls to defeat, while still giving you the opportunity to win big if they pull off an upset.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that this strategy won’t work for all matches. In fact, certain high-profile games – where there is a lot of money being wagered - may be best avoided altogether. So, always do your research before placing any bets!</p>
<h1 id="Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-NFL-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#Hey-low-method-blackjack-what-do-the-numbers-mean-NFL-tips-and-tricks" class="headerlink" title="Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: NFL tips and tricks"></a>Hey low method blackjack what do the numbers mean: NFL tips and tricks</h1><p>Super Bowl odds and whether you’re a fan of the game or just enjoy betting on it, there’s no question that NFL seasons are a big deal. Wagering on the NFL can be profitable, but there’s certainly more to it than blindly picking winners. In order to make money betting on the NFL, you need to understand what the numbers mean and how they impact games. </p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss some of the basic concepts of NFL wagering so that you can make smarter bets and hopefully walk away a winner this season.</p>
<p>POINT SPREADS</p>
<p>The point spread is easily the most common wager in NFL betting. This is a bet where you side with one team or the other, but instead of betting on who will win outright, you bet on how many points they will win or lose by. So, for example, if the New England Patriots are playing the Miami Dolphins and the point spread is -7 for New England, that means that New England is favored by 7 points and Betting $110 on them would return $100 if they won (remember that when betting you always bet $110 to get $100 back). If Miami were to upset New England, then somebody who bet on Miami would receive $210 for every $100 wagered since Miami would be an underdog of 7 points. The opposite would be true if New England were playing a team like the Cleveland Browns—in this case, New England would be an underdog of 7 points and somebody betting on them would only receive $190 back for every $100 wagered.</p>
<p>PARLAYS</p>
<p>A parlay is essentially a multiple-bet where you link together two or more individual bets into one single wager. To win a parlay, every individual bet within the parlay must hit. So, for example, if you place a 2-team parlay at odds of +200 (meaning your potential payout would be twice your original investment), then you would need both teams to win in order to collect your payout. Conversely, if you placed a 3-team parlay at +300 (meaning your potential payout would be three times your original investment), then any two of those three teams winning would result in a payday. </p>
<p>TEASERS<br>Another popular form of NFL wagering is teasers. A teaser allows you to move the point spread in your favor in exchange for accepting lower payouts. So, for example, let’s say that Team A is playing Team B and the usual point spread is 6 points. You could tease Team A down to 4 points which would mean that they are now favored by 2 points instead of 6. If they go on to win by exactly 4 points then your teaser still wins whereas if they won by 5 or more points then it would not count due to them being moved further into favoritism. Conversely, if Team A was an underdog of 4 points rather than 6 then teasing them up to 8 points would mean that they are now considered favorites by 4 points. If they lost by exactly 8 points then your teaser still loses while anything less than 8 point victory means you at least push (break even).<br>One important thing worth noting about teasers is that most sportsbooks only offer traditional teasers up to 7 teams while exotic teasers involving anywhere from 8-10 teams are available at some sportsbooks but come with much lower payouts – sometimes as low as even money (meaning you’d only break even). </p>
<p>OVER/UNDER WAGERS<br>This type of wager simply asks whether or not both total scores combined will be over or under a certain number set by oddsmakers. So let’s say that this week’s game between Dallas and Pittsburgh features an over/under total set at 45 points by Las Vegas oddsmakers – this means that either 46 or 47 total combined points scored between both teams will result in winners taking home cash profits whereas anything less than 45 total combined points results in losing tickets .</p>
<p>BETTING ON THE TOTALS WAGER ALONEThis final type of NFL wager doesn’t involve backing any particular team but rather just placing money down on whether or not both teams will score over or under a set number as described above with regards to over/under wagers generally speaking; however, unlike regular over/under bets where ties result in bookmakers keeping all stakes wagered , when betting totals alone ties result in half of all tickets winning (so if 2 people bet on Over 41 and 2 people bet Under 41 and 41 is scored then both Over and Under bets push while those who bet on 42+ and 34 or less lose).</p>
