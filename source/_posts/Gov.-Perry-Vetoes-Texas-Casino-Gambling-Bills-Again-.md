#  Gov. Perry Vetoes Texas Casino Gambling Bills Again 

Governor Rick Perry vetoed two bills concerning casino gambling in Texas on Monday, May 26. Senate Bill 17 and House Bill 78, both of which would have legalized casino gambling in the state, were vetoed by Perry for the second year in a row.

Supporters of the bills argued that legalizing casino gambling would help to create jobs and increase state revenue, but opponents claimed that casino gambling would lead to increased crime and social problems. Perry agreed with the latter assessment, saying “Texas should not promote illegal activity that can hurt our citizens.”

The vetoes are a major blow to those who support casino gambling in Texas, and it is now unlikely that any such measures will be passed during the current legislative session. This is good news for opponents of casino gambling, who argue that it is a vice that can have negative consequences for individuals and communities.

#  Why Doesn't Texas Allow Casino Gambling? 

There are a few reasons that Texas doesn't allow casino gambling. One reason is that the state believes that it would be harmful to the citizens of Texas. It is thought that casino gambling would lead to more crime, bankruptcy, and addiction. Another reason is that the state government would lose out on revenue from taxes if casino gambling was allowed. There is also the belief that casino gambling would harm the tourism industry in Texas.

#  Opposition to Gambling in Texas Remains High 

Despite the legalization of gambling in many other states, opposition to gambling in Texas remains high. This is likely due to the fact that gambling is not a particularly popular pastime in Texas. Nearly two-thirds of Texans have never gambled, and only around one in ten Texans gamble on a regular basis.

There are also concerns that gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. Studies have shown that problem gambling rates are higher in states with legalized gambling. In addition, there is evidence that gambling can lead to financial problems and marital discord.

Supporters of gambling argue that it can be a source of revenue for the state, and that it can help create jobs. But opponents argue that the benefits of gambling are outweighed by the costs. They say that the state should not be encouraging people to gamble, especially when there are so many risks involved.

#  Casinos Fail to Gain Traction in the Lone Star State 

Casinos are a big business, and they are expected to do well in a place like Texas. With its population of over 28 million, and with more than $100 billion in gambling revenue each year, there should be plenty of opportunity to make money in the casino industry. However, that has not been the case so far.



The two casinos that have opened in Texas – WinStar World Casino and Resort and Choctaw Casino Resort – only generated around $135 million in revenue in 2017. That is a far cry from the $1.5 billion that was generated by casinos in New Jersey in the same year, even though the population of New Jersey is less than one-tenth the size of Texas. 

There are several reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, the laws governing casinos are much more restrictive in Texas than they are in New Jersey. For example, casinos are not allowed to offer slot machines in Texas, which is a major source of revenue for casinos elsewhere. In addition, the competition from other forms of entertainment is much greater in Texas than it is in New Jersey. There are many more places to gamble (including state-run lottery games) and to go out to eat or see a show in Texas than there are in New Jersey. Finally, there is simply less interest among Texans in gambling than there is among residents of other states.

#  Schalke 04 Fans Still Waiting for Gambling in Texas

The Bundesliga club Schalke 04 may have some of the most loyal fans in the world, but they are still waiting for legalized gambling in Texas.

Though Schalke 04 has enjoyed a great deal of success on the pitch in recent years, the club’s fans have had to put up with a lot of disappointment off it. The team’s struggles in the German top flight have been well-documented, but one issue that hasn’t received as much attention is the fact that legalized gambling in Texas is still not available to Schalke 04 fans.

Texas is one of only a handful of states in the US that doesn’t offer some form of legalized gambling, and this has been a sore point for Schalke 04 supporters for many years. Gambling on Bundesliga matches is quite popular among fans in Germany, and it would be great if Schalke 04 supporters could also enjoy this pastime when watching their team play away from home.

There have been several attempts to legalize gambling in Texas over the years, but all of them have failed due to strong opposition from religious groups. These groups argue that gambling can lead to addiction and financial ruin, and they are determined to keep it illegal in Texas.

This situation is frustrating for Schalke 04 fans, as they are forced to miss out on what is an enjoyable experience for many other Bundesliga supporters. Hopefully, one day Texas will legalize gambling and Schalke 04 fans can finally enjoy watching their team play without having to worry about missing out on some fun betting opportunities.
