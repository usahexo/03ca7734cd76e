#  Blue Roulette Chips Worth a Fortune for Hasek!

The $2 Blue Series Roulette Chips from the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada are making headlines as they may be worth a fortune! In 2002, the casino switched to a new design and color scheme for their roulette chips. These now iconic blue chips were allegedly only used for two days before being pulled from the tables and put into storage.

As of March 2017, there were only six of these $2 Blue Series Roulette Chips known to exist and they are each estimated to be worth $15,000. That would make the entire set worth a whopping $90,000! And that's not even counting the fact that these chips could potentially be worth even more if they ever become a collector's item.

Interestingly enough, one of the six Blue Series Roulette Chips is owned by none other than Dominik Hasek, The Dominator himself! The Hall of Fame goaltender who played for both the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red Wings is reported to have won one of these rare chips at a blackjack table back in 2002.

While we can't verify if this story is true or not, it would certainly make for an interesting tale if it is. If Hasek happens to read this article, we'd love to get his take on the whole thing! In any case, this blue chip is definitely hot property and could end up being worth a fortune down the road.

#  How Much are Blue Roulette Chips Worth to Hasek?

In the NHL, blue roulette chips are worth nothing to Hasek.

This week, the Detroit Red Wings goaltender had an opportunity to win his fourth consecutive Vezina Trophy as the National Hockey League's top goalie. However, he came up short, losing out to New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur. Hasek was named one of three finalists for the award, along with Brodeur and Roberto Luongo of the Vancouver Canucks.

"I am very disappointed," said a down Hasek after learning he did not win the Vezina Trophy. "I worked hard all season and it is a great disappointment to come in second."

Hasek finishes the 2006-2007 regular season with a 37-18-6 record, 2.09 goals against average and .926 save percentage in 61 games played. He led all goaltenders in wins, goals against average and save percentage.

Despite his impressive stats, many believe that Brodeur was more deserving of the Vezina Trophy this season. "Marty was by far the best goalie in the league this year," said one NHL analyst. "He deserved to win the trophy."

Brodeur led the Devils to their ninth division title and third Stanley Cup Finals appearance in seven seasons. He compiled a 44-27-10 record with a 2.17 goals against average and .920 save percentage in 80 games played. He also recorded five shutouts during the 2006-2007 campaign.
