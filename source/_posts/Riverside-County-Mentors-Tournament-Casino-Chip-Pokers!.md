#  Money A Black Poker Tournament In Riverside County!

In the Inland Empire of Southern California, a new poker room has opened that is hosting black-only tournaments. The room, which is in Riverside County, is called "Poker Utopia". It is the only poker room in California that hosts black-only tournaments.

The owner of Poker Utopia, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he started the tournaments because he was not able to find any other tournaments that were open to blacks. He said that he knows there are many black poker players out there who would love to have a place where they can play without having to worry about being discriminated against.

The tournaments are held every other Saturday, and they usually draw between 15 and 20 players. The buy-in is $60, and the prize pool usually reaches $600 or more. The winner takes home the majority of the prize pool, while the rest of the players usually take home small consolation prizes.

Many of the players who attend these tournaments say that they feel welcome and appreciated at Poker Utopia. They enjoy being able to play with other people who share their cultural background. They also appreciate the fact that the tournament director and other staff members are always willing to help them out if they need it.

Some people have criticized Poker Utopia for hosting segregated tournaments, but the owner says that he has no intention of stopping them. He believes that it is important for black players to have a place where they can feel comfortable and safe playing poker. He also believes that it is important for black businesses to support each other, and he hopes that his tournament will help promote black-owned businesses in the Inland Empire.
