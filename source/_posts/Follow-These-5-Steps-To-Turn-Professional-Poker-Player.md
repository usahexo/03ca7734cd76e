#  How To Turn Professional Poker Player Without Breaking The Bank

Making the decision to become a professional poker player is not one that should be taken lightly. Not only do you need the drive and passion to succeed in the highly competitive world of poker, but you must also have the financial resources to support yourself while you hone your skills.

One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming a professional poker player is that you need to have a lot of money to get started. While it is certainly helpful to have some financial cushion, it is not necessary. In fact, there are a number of ways you can turn pro without breaking the bank.

Here are a few tips for aspiring poker players on how to make the jump from amateur to professional without spending too much money:

1. Start small: When starting out, it is important to keep your overhead low. This means playing at smaller stakes tables until you are comfortable with the game and have built up a bankroll. There is no need to rush into playing at higher stakes games and risking your hard-earned money.

2. Choose your games wisely: Not all forms of poker are created equal when it comes to profitability. For instance, heads-up cash games tend to be more lucrative than tournaments, while stud games offer greater opportunities for manipulation than Hold’em. Choose the games that fit your style and give you the best chance of winning.

3. Get sponsored: One way to reduce your costs as a professional poker player is to find a sponsor. Sponsors can provide everything from free or discounted room and board, travel expenses, and even tournament entries. There are a number of online resources (such as PokerSponsorships) where you can find potential sponsors.

4. Stay disciplined: Making money in poker takes patience and discipline – two things that can be in short supply when playing under pressure at high stakes tables. It is important to remember that Rome was not built in a day, and success in poker does not come overnight either. Stick to your gameplan, and don’t let emotions get the best of you.

5. Use online tools: As a professional poker player, it is important to make use of all the tools available to you in order to improve your game. This includes online training sites like PokerStrategy, as well as tracking software like PT4 or Holdem Manager 2 which can help you identify areas for improvement in your play.

#  Tips For Turning Professional Poker Player

Aspiring poker players often dream of one day making a living playing the game they love. And indeed, it is possible to make a good income from poker. But turning professional is not easy, and there is no surefire path to success. Here are some tips for making the transition from amateur to professional poker player:

1. Set achievable goals and work hard to achieve them

It’s important to have realistic expectations for what you can achieve as a professional poker player. Winning a major tournament is not likely, but grinding out a modest living through regular play is definitely doable. Stay focused on your goals and put in the effort required to reach them.

2. Have a strong game theory foundation

The better your theoretical understanding of the game, the more successful you will be as a professional poker player. There are many resources available that can help you improve your game theory skills, including books, articles, and online courses.

3. Take advantage of coaching and training opportunities

There are many excellent coaches and training programs available for aspiring poker players. These can provide you with invaluable insights into how to improve your game and become more successful at live and online poker tournaments.

4. Treat poker like a business

Professional poker players are like any other small business owners - they need to track their expenses and revenue, manage their bankrolls carefully, and stay disciplined with their playing habits. Making the switch to professional requires adopting a responsible and disciplined approach to your gambling activity.

#  Making The Leap From Amateur Poker Player To Professional 

There’s a big difference between playing poker for fun and playing poker for a living. The skillset required to be successful at the latter is much greater, as is the potential financial return.

But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to make the jump from amateur player to professional. With hard work, dedication and a bit of luck, it can be done.

Here are a few tips to help you on your way:

1. Play Often

If you want to be a professional poker player, you need to play often. This means not just tournament poker, but also cash games and sit & go’s. The more hands you play, the better informed you’ll be about what works and what doesn’t. You’ll also start to develop instincts which will help you in difficult situations.

2. Study Poker Strategies

In order to improve your chances of making the jump to pro, you need to study poker strategies. There are plenty of books and websites available on this topic, so take advantage of them. Make sure you understand all the concepts before moving on to the next one – there is no point in learning something if you don’t fully comprehend it.

3. Get Good at Maths

A strong knowledge of maths is essential for any professional poker player. This is because basic mathematical concepts such as odds and percentages come into play often in poker games. If you can do complex calculations in your head quickly, you will have a definite edge over your opponents.

4. Stay Calm Under Pressure

One of the most important qualities for any poker player is being able to stay calm under pressure. If you start making bad decisions when your chips are down, it’s unlikely you will make it as a pro. It takes practice and experience to gain this type of composure – so keep playing even when things aren’t going your way.
