#  Where can you find them? 
Finding dragonflies is not as hard as one might think. There are many places to look, and it just takes a bit of patience and perseverance. 

One popular spot is near ponds and slow-moving streams. Dragonflies like these habitats because they provide plenty of food and a place to lay their eggs. Dragonflies can also be found in meadows, gardens, and along the edges of forests. They often perch on tall grasses or other vegetation to watch for prey. 

To increase your chances of seeing a dragonfly, visit these places during late morning or early afternoon when the sun is out. Look for flying insects and try to get close without frightening them away. Be patient—dragonflies can be elusive!

#  How much do they cost? 

A question that is commonly asked, "How much do they cost?" The answer to this question may vary greatly due to individual circumstances. A basic breakdown of some of the factors involved in the cost of owning a horse are as follows:
First and foremost, the cost of hay and straw will be a major expense. Horses require a lot of roughage to keep their digestive systems working properly, and good-quality hay can be expensive. In some cases, straw may need to be purchased in addition to hay to provide a sufficient bed for the animal.
Another important factor is pasture fees. If the horse lives on pasture full-time, there will be no additional costs associated with it, but most horses require access to pasture for only part of the day, which means their owners will have to pay for grazing rights. 
The third biggest expense is usually veterinary care. Horses require regular checkups and preventive care, and if they become sick or injured, treatment can be very costly. 
Last but not least, there are equipment costs to consider. A good quality saddle, bridle, and other tack can easily run into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
So how much does it cost to own a horse? It really depends on your specific situation, but on average, you can expect to spend at least $500 per year on basics like hay and straw, plus another $500-$1000 per year for other expenses like pasture fees, vet care, and equipment.

#  What are the benefits of owning them?

When it comes to owning a pet, there are many benefits to be had. From reducing stress levels to providing companionship, pets can improve our overall wellbeing in a number of ways. In this article, we’re going to take a look at some of the key benefits associated with pet ownership.

# 1: Pets provide companionship

One of the most important benefits of owning a pet is that they provide us with companionship. According to research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, those who own pets are more likely to have increased social interactions and stronger relationships than those who don’t own pets. This is because pets provide us with an opportunity to talk about our day-to-day lives and share our experiences with someone else. Pets can also help us feel less alone in times of sadness or stress.

# 2: Pets can reduce stress levels

Pets can also help to reduce our stress levels. A study published in the journal Health Psychology found that when people were exposed to stressful situations, those who owned dogs experienced significantly lower levels of cortisol (a hormone that is released in response to stress) than those who didn’t own dogs. Other studies have shown that simply looking at photos of animals can help to reduce stress levels. This is likely because animals provide us with a sense of calm and relaxation.

# 3: Pets can improve our mental health

Not only can pets help to reduce our stress levels, but they can also improve our mental health as well. A study published in the journal BMC Psychiatry found that people who suffer from mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety often see a significant improvement in their symptoms after adopting a pet. Pets can also help us feel more connected to the world around us and increase our sense of self-worth.

# 4: Pets can improve our physical health

Finally, pets can also improve our physical health by providing us with exercise. A study published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health found that dog owners were more likely to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity than those who didn’t own dogs. Owning a pet can also encourage us to eat more healthy foods as we want to ensure that our furry friends are getting the best possible nutrition.
