#  How to Place Friends in Zynga Poker NFL for Maximum enjoyment!

The first thing that you are going to want to do is make sure that you have enough friends that you can fill up all of the available spots in your Zynga Poker NFL game. Ideally, you will want to have at least nine friends to play with, but you can go as high as twelve if you really want to maximize your enjoyment. Once you have your friends ready, it is time to start the game!

The first order of business is to select the right formation for your team. You will want to think about what type of players you have and what type of offense or defense works best for your team. There are a few different formations that you can choose from, so take your time and select the one that gives your team the best chance of winning.

After you have selected your formation, it is time to start picking players for your team. This part can be a little tricky, especially if you are not familiar with the players in the NFL. However, there are a few things that you can do to make sure that you pick the right players for your team.

First, take a look at each player’s stats and see how they compare against other players at their position. If one player has better stats than another player, then he is likely a better choice for your team. You should also take into account how well each player performs in the offense or defense of your chosen formation.

Finally, pay attention to how well each player meshes with the rest of your team. This may be more important than any other factor, as it will determine how successful your team can be on the field. If two players do not get along or do not work well together, then they should not be on the same team!

Once you have picked all of the players for your team, it is time to put them into the game! Make sure that you save your game before starting so that you can reload it if something goes wrong. Then, simply select each player on your team and drag them onto the field in their corresponding positions.

Once all of your players are on the field, it is time to start playing football! The goal of Zynga Poker NFL is to score more points than the other team, so try to move the ball downfield and score touchdowns whenever possible. Remember to use all of your players on the field effectively in order to gain an advantage over the competition!
