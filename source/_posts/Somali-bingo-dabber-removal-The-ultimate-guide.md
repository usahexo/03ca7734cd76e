#  How to clean a bingo dauber from carpet

Cleaning a bingo dauber from carpeting can seem like a daunting task, but it's really not that difficult. In fact, there are a few different ways to go about it.

One way is to pour a little bit of vinegar onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, use a rag or sponge to scrub at the stain until it's gone. Be sure to rinse the area well afterwards.

Another way is to use some diluted dish soap. Again, pour it onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing it away. Again, be sure to rinse the area well when you're finished.

If neither of those methods seems to be working, you can also try using a carpet cleaner. Just make sure to test it in an inconspicuous spot first in case the carpeting is sensitive.

Whichever method you choose, be sure to always blot rather than scrubbing at the stain. That will only make it worse. And remember to rinse well when you're finished!
