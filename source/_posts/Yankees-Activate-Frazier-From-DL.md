#  Yankees Activate Frazier From DL

The New York Yankees activated third baseman Todd Frazier from the disabled list prior to Friday night's game against the Toronto Blue Jays.

Frazier had been out since Aug. 4 with a strained oblique muscle. The 31-year-old is batting .213 with 22 homers and 59 RBI in 99 games this season.

To make room for Frazier on the active roster, the Yankees optioned infielder Tyler Wade to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

The Ratiopharm Ulm basketball team registered a solid home win against the Telekom Baskets Bonn squad in Round 24 of the German League. Ahead of the matchup, Coach Thorsten Leibenath spoke about how his side was focused and determined to come away with the victory. 
Ratiopharm Ulm opened up a large lead in the first half, and though Bonn made a game of it in the second,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) they were never really able to get over the hump. The final score was 84-75 in favor of Ulm, who improved their record to 19-5 on the season. 
Import players Xavier Marshall and Aaron Doornekamp led the way for Ulm with 16 points apiece, while centre John Bryant chipped in with 14 points and 8 rebounds. 
Despite the victory, Coach Leibenath was not completely satisfied with his team’s performance. “We had sloppy moments where we didn’t execute well on offense or defense”, he said. “But we were able to pull through in the end and that’s what counts.” 
The win keeps Ulm within striking distance of first place in the standings, although they will need some help from other teams if they are to overtake FC Bayern Munich at the top. 
Ulm will be back in action this coming weekend when they travel to play newly-promoted side Mitteldeutscher BC.

#  Frazier Goes 3-For-4 In Return, Yankees Top Royals

Gary Sanchez hit a three-run homer, Masahiro Tanaka pitched six innings of two-hit ball and the New York Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 5-0 on Friday night.

Greg Bird also homered for the Yankees, who have won four of five. Chase Headley had an RBI single in his return from the disabled list and Starlin Castro had two hits and scored twice.

Tanaka (8-4) allowed a leadoff single to Lorenzo Cain in the second inning and then retired 19 consecutive batters until Alex Gordon's double leading off the seventh. The right-hander struck out seven, walked none and lowered his ERA to 3.11.

Frazier was activated from the disabled list before the game after being sidelined since May 2 with a strained left hamstring. He went 3 for 4, scoring twice.

Jason Hammel (2-7) allowed four runs on eight hits over six innings for Kansas City.

#  Frazier Hits go-ahead HR in 8th as Yanks top LA

The New York Yankees hit a two-out, go-ahead homer in the eighth inning on Wednesday and held on to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 to split their two-game series at Dodger Stadium.

Dustin Fowler led off the eighth inning with a single against Dodgers reliever Pedro Baez (3-5) and advanced to second when Giancarlo Stanton followed with a walk. Aaron Judge was intentionally walked to load the bases and Didi Gregorius hit a grounder to first baseman Cody Bellinger, who tried to get Fowler at the plate.

But Fowler slid in safely ahead of catcher Yasmani Grandal's throw as Bellinger made an errant swipe at him, scoring the go-ahead run.

"I thought he did a great job of reading it," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of Fowler's slide. "He was busting his butt down the line."

Aroldis Chapman pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 27th save in 30 opportunities.

Dodgers starter Alex Wood allowed one run on six hits over 6 1/3 innings. He struck out eight and walked one.

Yankees starter Lance Lynn allowed two runs on five hits over six innings. He struck out four and walked one.

#  Yankees place Justus Sheffield on DL

The Yankees placed their prized pitching prospect Justus Sheffield on the disabled list Wednesday with a left shoulder injury.

Sheffield is a key piece of the Yankees' future and was expected to compete for a spot in the starting rotation this season. He was 2-1 with a 2.25 ERA in five starts at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

"He's been electric," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Tuesday of Sheffield. "He's got that mid-90s (mph) fastball and then he can back it up with a really good changeup."

The Yankees recalled left-hander Dietrich Enns from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take Sheffield's place on the roster.
