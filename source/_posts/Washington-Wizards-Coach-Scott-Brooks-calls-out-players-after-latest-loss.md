#  Washington Wizards Coach Scott Brooks calls out players after latest loss

It was a frustrating night all around for the Washington Wizards. Coach Scott Brooks was visibly upset with his team's play, calling them out after their latest loss.

"We're not playing hard," Brooks said. "We're not competing. We're making it too easy on the other team."

It was a disheartening scene for a team that had high hopes coming into the season. But things went from bad to worse in the second half, when Tomas Satoransky got ejected for throwing an elbow.

"He has to be smarter than that," Brooks said of Satoransky. "He knows that he can't do that."

The Wizards are now 4-7 on the season and need to turn things around fast if they want to make the postseason. They'll have an opportunity to do that when they take on the Miami Heat on Wednesday night.

#  Wall, Beal and Porter Jr. underperforming

Washington Wizards are in the NBA playoffs, but their stars are not shining.

Bradley Beal, John Wall and Otto Porter Jr. were expected to lead the Washington Wizards deep into the playoffs, but they have yet to live up to expectations.

Wall is averaging just 16 points and eight assists per game in the playoffs so far. He has shot just 41 percent from the field and 26 percent from three-point range.

Beal is averaging 19 points per game in the playoffs, but is shooting just 38 percent from the field and 31 percent from three-point range.

Porter Jr. is averaging 14 points per game in the playoffs, but is shooting just 37 percent from the field and 27 percent from three-point range.

#  Tim Frazier could be the answer to the Wizards' problems

The Washington Wizards have not had the best of seasons this year. They are currently sitting in 13th place in the Eastern Conference, with a record of 27-41. Some people are calling for the team to rebuild, and trade away their key players.

One player who has been mentioned in trade rumors is point guard Tim Frazier. Frazier was traded to the Wizards from the New Orleans Pelicans in February. He has been a bright spot for the team, averaging 9.2 points and 5.8 assists per game.

Frazier could be a valuable asset for the Wizards if they decide to rebuild. He is under contract for next season, and he is a cheap option at $2 million per year. He would be a great addition to any team looking for a point guard.

The Wizards should consider trading Frazier if they can get good value in return. He could be the answer to another team's problems, and he could help them make a run in the playoffs.

#  Washington Wizards must make a trade for a star player

The Washington Wizards have a very talented roster. However, they are missing that one star player that can take them to the next level. If they want to make a deep postseason run, they will need to make a trade for a star player.

There are several players that would be a good fit for the Wizards. One player that comes to mind is Carmelo Anthony. He is a scoring machine and would be a great addition to the team. Another player that could be available is Paul George. He is an excellent defender and would complement John Wall and Bradley Beal well.

If the Wizards cannot land one of those players, there are still some other options available. Kemba Walker is another scorer who could help out Washington. Another option is Gordon Hayward who can do a little bit of everything on the court.

Whoever the Wizards decide to go after, they need to act fast. The NBA trade deadline is coming up soon and they cannot afford to miss out on this opportunity.

#  Washington Wizards need to find their identity

The Washington Wizards are in the middle of a transitional period. They are no longer the team led by John Wall and Bradley Beal, but they are not yet a team with a clear identity. This has been evident in their inconsistency this season.

One of the main issues for the Wizards is that they have not been able to find a consistent way to score points. They have relied too much on Wall and Beal to carry the offense, and this has caused them to become very one-dimensional. As a result, they have been unable to win games against good teams.

One way for the Wizards to fix this issue is by finding more players who can score consistently. Otto Porter Jr. has been inconsistent this season, and it would be helpful if he could become more reliable offensively. Kelly Oubre Jr. has also shown flashes of potential, but he needs to continue to develop his offensive game.

In addition to finding more scoring options, the Wizards also need to improve their defense. They have allowed too many opponents to score easily in the paint, and they have not done a good job of protecting the rim. If they want to be successful in the playoffs, they will need to improve their defense significantly.

Overall, the Wizards need to find their identity if they want to be successful in the future. They need to develop more players who can score consistently, and they need to improve their defensive intensity. If they can do these things, then they will be in a much better position going forward.
